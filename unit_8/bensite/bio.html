		<h1>Instant Rice</h1>
		<p>Ben Rice has been performing stand-up in Sacramento since early 2011. He first took the stage on a dare, attempting to prove that his rapid, slurred speech and mumbling goes away when he has a mic in his hand. Armed with nothing but puns and jokes about Walmart shoppers being ugly, another comic told him he was funny and Ben never looked back. Fortunately for all involved, his joke-writing and on-stage persona came together quickly. Tommy T's booker Ruben Mora, after seeing Ben's second-ever performance, called it "an embarrassment" and hoped never to see Ben again. After a few months, the progress made was notable and Ben was reaching the finals of local comedy competitions. Now, Ben is Ruben's go-to guy for a dead open mic or an emergency host, praising him for his rapid ascension as a comedic talent.
